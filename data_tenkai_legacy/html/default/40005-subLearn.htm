If your subclass is strong enough, that class' power can be transferred to your main class. <br>
But this is a dangerous feat. Your power must be proven through certification. <br>
If you have a certificate, I will do a partial transfer on you.<br>Now, will you learn the subclass skills transferred
onto the main class? <br>
