Discipline and endless training to bring your subclass up to a certain level open your eyes to new powers.
<br1>
    Now, let's see how much your training has taught you.
    <br1>
        By the way, to receive this certification, <font color="LEVEL">your current class must be the class of the
        subclass or dual class you want to be certified for; you also need to be level 65 or above, and in the case of
        the dual class, level 85 or above</font>.
        <br1>
            So, do you want to be certified? Or do you want to learn skills with the certification you received? <br>
