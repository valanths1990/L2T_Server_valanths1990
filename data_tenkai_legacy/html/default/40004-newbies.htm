                    <td align=center fixwidth=250>Don't panic! You have enough adena to get full R99 blessed gear and
                        even enhance it a bit. Enchanting is safe and very cheap until +16! Also, notice that you're
                        level 99 and you can awaken already.<br>
                        After that you should be able to go to Raider's Crossroads and get a good bunch of adena and
                        experience already, but if the monsters are still too strong for you there's always Nornil's
                        Cave. Their loot is not very good, but it's nice for you to get some extra initial adena and
                        experience.<br>
                        Also, make sure you take a close look at the General Merchant and the Services NPC and check all
                        their options to make sure you find what you're looking for.<br>
                        <br>
                        Welcome to L2Tenkai! I hope you have lots of fun with us.
